# Piet-Mondrian
This project is an imitation of the famous painting of Piet Mondrian. The project summarizes learnings about layouts in details, Constraint Layout in particular. Along with it, the popular features of constraint layout such as ratios, chaining, baseline, etc. Overall, the project is a good starter to get hands-on with layouts and understanding how flexible they can be. Cheers!
